Project Name: Bank Management System (Java)

Project Description:
This is a console-based Java application designed to manage bank accounts.
The system allows users to create multiple accounts, deposit money, withdraw money, and view account details.
It also saves account data using file handling so that information is preserved even after closing the program.
The project demonstrates core Java concepts including Object-Oriented Programming (Classes and Objects), ArrayList, File I/O, and Exception Handling.

Key Features:

Create new bank accounts with account number, name, and initial balance

Deposit money into accounts

Withdraw money with balance validation

View all accounts with details

Save and load data using file handling


Learning Outcome:

Implemented real-world banking functionality using Java

Practiced OOP principles and ArrayList operations

Learned to handle exceptions and user inputs safely

Gained experience with file handling for persistent data storage


Tools & Technologies:

Core Java

Object-Oriented Programming

ArrayList

File I/O (Serialization)

Console-based interface


Role:
I developed this project independently to strengthen my Java programming skills and prepare for Zoho’s examless selection process.
